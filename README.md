Robotic interfacing

Shoppers are acutely aware of germs right now, and they are doing everything they can to avoid them. To assist retailers, such as grocers, in their mission to prioritize new sanitation strategies, they’re getting a little help from a [familiar friend](https://www.business.att.com/learn/top-voices/robots-in-the-aisles-the-future-of-grocery.html): autonomous robots.

The AT&T Internet of Things (IoT) team joined forces with Brain Corp, a San Diego-based technology company specializing in the development of intelligent, autonomous navigation systems for everyday machines. The mission here? To keep retailers cleaner to help keep their employees and shoppers safer.

Brain Corp has deployed or enabled approximately 10,000 automated floor scrubbers and other robots used by big box retailers, grocery stores, airports and shopping malls across the U.S.

By pairing AT&T connectivity with Brain Corp’s cloud-enabled Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, these robots are able to more efficiently clean retail environments while also scanning inventory through video analytics. The robots will produce high resolution pictures of retail and grocery aisles in near-real time. This will aid retailers in restocking and merchandising their shelves.

“Brain Corp’s advanced robotics technology is the way of the future,” said Christina Spencer, business development manager on the AT&T IoT team. “For us to be a part of this through our platform and connectivity is exciting. It is even more timely to be a part of something that’s helping the community.”

In the face of panic buying and cleanliness concerns, retailers instituted government protocols to protect public health. Customers want every assurance that their shopping experiences will be safe and that the products that they need will be available. So, if ever there was a time to lean on our robotic friends, it’s now.

Chris Penrose, AT&T Senior Vice President, Advanced Solutions, said, “The COVID-19 crisis is a clear example of how advanced technology and IoT solutions can radically improve the way we approach and solve societal challenges.”
